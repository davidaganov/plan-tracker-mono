# Feature documentation

This folder documents feature-level flows (typically routing-driven pages).

## How to use these docs

- Start from the feature README before changing a page flow.
- Use feature docs to understand:
  - routing entry points
  - composition (what the page is made of)
  - data sources (stores/services/composables)
  - cross-feature links
